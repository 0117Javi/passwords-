# passwords-
homework 3 JS


first thing i did was to make a variable  "bank" for the numbers, letters, and so on. and also made blank bank for the characters to go once they were selected.

next i tried to set up a way for the user to pick the set of characters they wanted. 

i wrote out the 'if' statements to pass them off as true of false.  

after that was to make a variable for each character case and prompt to confirm the variable. 

after that was the most difficult for me, i tried with little to no success to set the range of characters from 8-120. most of my time went to trying to figure that out but i gave up.
